Reward Wrappers
===============

This module defines custom reward shaping techniques using Gymnasiumâ€™s :code:`RewardWrapper`.
These wrappers are used to modify the reward function to improve learning dynamics.

Descriptions
------------

- **PositionDelayWrapper**: Delays reward until the agent crosses a predefined position (`position_delay`). Also includes a control cost penalty to discourage erratic actions.
