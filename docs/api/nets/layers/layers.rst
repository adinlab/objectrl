Layer Module
=============

The **Layer** module provides reusable components for building flexible and probabilistic neural architectures.
It includes:

- **Bayesian layers**: for uncertainty-aware learning using Bayesian inference.
- **Heads**: for transforming neural outputs into actionable distributions in reinforcement learning.
