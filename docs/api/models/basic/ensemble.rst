Ensemble
=========

Generic neural network ensemble container designed to hold multiple model instances with shared architecture but independent parameters.

Key Points:

- Provides batched parameter storage for efficient parallel forward passes using :class:`torch.func`.

- Supports expanding input tensors to match ensemble size.

- Allows extraction of single ensemble members as standalone models.

- Useful as a building block for model ensembles such as the :class:`CriticEnsemble`.

.. note::

   Increasing the number of ensemble members improves robustness but increases computational cost.

.. warning::

   Incorrect parameter extraction when retrieving single ensemble members can lead to inconsistent behavior.


Here are the detailed methods and attributes.
